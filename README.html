ðŸŽ¹ Digital Piano (Embedded Systems Project)<br>
A real-time digital piano built on the MSPM0G3507 microcontroller using C and ARM Cortex-M0+ assembly. The system integrates a 5-bit DAC and 4-bit keyboard to generate musical tones with precise timing.<br>

Features<br>
Real-time audio generation via SysTick interrupts<br>
Low-latency keypress-to-sound mapping (<10ms)<br>
Support for multiple musical notes and smooth playback<br>
Demonstrates embedded systems programming, hardware-software integration, and signal processing fundamentals<br>
